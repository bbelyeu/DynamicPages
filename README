CakePhp 2.x Plugin for creating dynamic pages in cake with custom content

Setup:
1. Import dynamic_pages.sql in Config/Schema/

2. Add the following line to your app/Config/bootstrap.php
    CakePlugin::load('DynamicPages', array('routes' => true));

3. With the routes enabled, any url with a single /:name will match
    the route for the DynamicPages controller. Thus, if you want to use 
    /:controller to access a controller's index function then you'll need 
    to specifically add that to your app/Config/routes.php file. Otherwise
    this plugin will match the route and handle it before it gets to your controller.

4. Use /admin/pages to manage pages

5. You can use the beforeRender() method in your app/Controller/AppController class
    to assign a different Layout or View file inside your app folder structure.
    Inside beforeRender() add the conditional statement:
    if ($this instanceOf PagesController && $this->request->params['plugin'] === 'DynamicPages') {
        // code goes here
    }
    to catch any calls to the DynamicPages plugin.
    Inside the conditional you can change the layout by setting $this->layout or
    render a view from /app/Config/View by adding a line:
    $this->render('/ViewFile');
    "ViewFile" must be located inside app/View.

6. Style pages with your site css. The following structure is  the default view.
<div class="pages view">
    <h2 class="title">...</h2>
    <p class="copy">...</p>
</div>
