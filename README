CakePhp 2.x Plugin for creating dynamic pages in cake with custom content

Setup:
1. Clone repo into app/Plugins folder

2. Import pages.sql in Config/Schema/

3. Add the following line to your app/Config/bootstrap.php
    CakePlugin::load('DynamicPages', array('routes' => true));

4. If you want to use a custom header image for the page it is configured
    to work my default with my MysqlImageStorage plugin for a hasOne relationship.
    If you don't want to use an image, simply comment out the $hasOne property
    in the Page Model along with any associated fields in the view files.

4. With the routes enabled, any url with a single /:name will match
    the route for the DynamicPages controller. Thus, if you want to use 
    /:controller to access a controller's index function then you'll need 
    to specifically add that to your app/Config/routes.php file. Otherwise
    this plugin will match the route and handle it before it gets to your controller.

5. To use custom views add a folder called DynamicPages inside your app/View 
    folder. Then place the custom views you'd like to use inside there.
    They will be available for selection from the admin screen.

6. Use /admin/pages to manage pages

7. If you don't use a custom view you can still style the pages with your site 
    css. The following structure is  the default view.
<div class="pages view">
    <img />
    <h2 class="title">...</h2>
    <p class="copy">...</p>
</div>
